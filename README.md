# Expo Camera Preview Freeze on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the camera preview freezes on certain Android devices after prolonged use or when switching between the front and rear cameras. The issue is particularly noticeable after taking several photos in succession.

## Bug Description

The camera preview becomes unresponsive;  no images can be captured, and no error messages are readily apparent in the console logs.  The app remains functional, but the camera preview is frozen.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an affected Android device (testing on various devices is highly recommended).
3. Use the app to take several pictures, switching between cameras.
4. Observe that after some time, the camera preview freezes.

## Solution

A potential solution involves implementing a more robust error handling mechanism within the Camera component, such as periodically checking the camera state and resetting the camera if it becomes unresponsive. This may require using the `Camera.getStatusAsync()` method to monitor the camera's health and restart it when needed. A more complete fix might involve waiting for a confirmed camera availability event after initiating a camera switch or reset before rendering the new preview.
